GUI - Basically Java Layer and from our team Abhijit Is handling

Server Layer -: GUI process, PP Process ,
			It create 2 instance ,
				Capture Instance, Decoding instance,
				
STT Code Capture inatnce	-: TCP IP Protocol, SOCKET

  -- Server Layer -: STT GUI Process
===================================================================================================================================================================  
  When you start STT GUI Process, It will create 2 STT Core instance 
		Capture Instance - STT Core Instance
		decoding Instance - STT Core Instance
	They will be communicating Server (GUI) using TCP IP protocol using socket connection
	
	==
	Lets Assume User clicks on start capture button
	At that time STT GUI send JSON command throught socket connection to the STT core capture instance Saying that user has requested start capture .
	  
	STT code handling commands acordingly it will start captring data and process data And store into session databased.
	
	Now -: STT core Decoding instance pickup the data if we have enabled Automatic decoding
	
	Lets assume that we have not enabled 
		STT decoding instacne will not doing anything here.
	Now Wen it comes into picture-:
		I have imported a file and process is completed.And after imporing file manually load decoders then at that time STT core decodding comes into picture-	
			It will start decoding session database the each msg in session it will apply associated decoder and it will send information to GUI.
			
		Note -: even if we apply decoder here we do not write decoder information to a database. The decoding information only displyed into GUI.
		For Example- : We imported file, Applyed decoders, Now close the session. And if re open the session data will not decoded. To decode that data we need to re applu decoders.
		            -: Thats why STT Decoding instance only read from database.
==========================================================================================================================
STT -: Capture Instance -:
	  Very 1st
		Capture service API and Execution thread-:
			--: when user interact, GUI will send commands in JSON from to the backend, Now the backend will process the command using the execution thread.
			    And that will trigger Engine Capture service.
				
			Lets -: Suppose user start capture, STT GUI ask Start capture instance to capture data.
					And Assuming that all connection and configuration properly done by user.
					The flow will start from here from the modem. we have different data interface USB, PCI, SOCKET interface.
					Here we are using socket to read the data.They will start reading data from the modem.
					
					After reading the data will store into circular buffer. now circular bufffer shared between capture Thread and store thread.
					So capture thread keep reading the datta and pushing into circular bufffer and store thread will check there is data to write.
					Job of Store Thread-:
							It will check if there is data available then it will write to ISTP file. So this is how an ISTP file created.
					
					So whatever file we staored ISTP file that is Raw ISTP file. There is no processing untill this point.
					
					Now STT Side procesing comes here. Import thered comes into picture-	
						
					->Importing thread can be done in two ways:
						1.Live capture
						2.Import ISTP file
						-> In both the ways the input file will be the raw ISTP file
						-> In live capture, ISTP file will be created by store thread
						-> In import thread file location has to be provide manually to import file directly.
						
					Import Thread-:
					Job -: To stream detection part
						->Import thread do stream detection
						- For platform 7660 the stream type is STPv2
						-> 7560 & 7660 are different type of modems (Different version of Modem) (Variation of modem)
						-> but 7660 version using STPv2 because there is an upgrade in the protocol.
						-> For platform 7560 & earlier the stream type is ISTP file
						-> To detect different formats of files we designed stream detection to know what kind of data we are receiving
						-> The extension of STPv2 file is .istp but the format will be different.
